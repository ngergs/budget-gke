# terraform setup

## Prerequisites
Besides terraform gcloud (Google Cloud SDK) has to be installed.

## Adjust the variables
Adjust the variables in terraform.tfvars. The following variables are provided:
* project_id: Project id of a project on GCP
* region: region where the kubernetes cluster will be setup
* location: location/zone where the kubernetes cluster will be setup. Has to be a zone the region that has been defined above.
* admin_cicr_block: CIDR block of ip-adresses that should have access to the kubernetes admin console.

## Apply:
If not already logged in via gcloud, login:
```
gcloud auth login
```
Then apply the terraform script
```
terraform init
terraform apply
```
Afterwards you can run the init_kubectl.sh script to initialize kubectl for the created cluster. This script runs:
```
#!/bin/bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials $(terraform output -raw kubernetes_cluster_name) --region $(terraform output -raw location)
```
In the out/helm_values.yml-file some relevant variables are provided as output to be used by some of the helm charts.
